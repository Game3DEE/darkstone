- O3D (static meshes)
  - Figure out face flags (transparency?)
- SKA/MBR/MDL/... (skeleton-based animations and meshes)
  - Figure out format!
- CDF (rooms)
  - How to map Trap / Monster IDs
- SPT (scripts)
  - Write parser/interpreter for scripts

- Review PSX/Android port UIs and decide on what to use
  * Got to keep in mind that Darkstone Web could run on Desktop, Mobile, Tablet, etc.
